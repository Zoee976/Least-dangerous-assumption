      <h2>What is the Least Dangerous Assumption?</h2>
      <p>
        The Least Dangerous Assumption (LDA) is a concept rooted in inclusive education and disability advocacy. It encourages educators, parents, and stakeholders to presume competence and potential in individuals with disabilities unless proven otherwise. This principle ensures that opportunities for learning, participation, and independence are maximized.
      </p>
      <p>
        First introduced by Anne Donnellan in 1984, the LDA suggests that the risk of underestimating someone's abilities is far greater than overestimating them. By presuming competence, educators can foster an environment of trust, respect, and high expectations.

      <h2>Why the Least Dangerous Assumption Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Presuming competence leads to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Students with disabilities receive access to the same educational opportunities as their peers.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Individuals develop confidence and skills to advocate for themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusion:</strong> Promotes integration in classrooms and communities, reducing stigma and isolation.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term impact:</strong> Higher expectations can lead to better academic, social, and employment outcomes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Applications in Special Education</h2>
      <p>
        The LDA informs a wide range of educational practices, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) that emphasize strengths and potential.</li>
        <li>Providing access to general education curricula with appropriate supports and accommodations.</li>
        <li>Implementing assistive technologies to aid communication, mobility, and learning.</li>
        <li>Encouraging participation in inclusive classrooms and extracurricular activities.</li>
        <li>Fostering collaboration between educators, families, and students.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By applying the LDA, educators can create learning environments where all students feel valued and capable.
